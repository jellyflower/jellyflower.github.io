The latest release of μTorrent features in-client ads ([here](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/11/09/utorrent-3-22-released-officially-supports-windows-8-and-now-displays-ads-in-client/)). The once concise and no-nonsense BitTorrent client is now taking a path to bloatware.

To turn off the ads, go to Preferences, and then Advanced, and set the following variables to false:

* offers.left_rail_offer_enabled
* offers.sponsored_torrent_offer_enabled

Click OK and restart the program. The ads should be gone now.

I actually switched to another client called [Tixati](http://www.tixati.com/). Currently it works well for me, and it has no nonsense.
