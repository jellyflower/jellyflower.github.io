Iâ€™m very interested in the latest features of C++11 so I want to get the latest version of GCC for Windows. It looks like at the moment the [MinGW-w64](http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/) project best fits my need. Check the builds [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/rubenvb/gcc-4.7-release/) if you target 64-bit Windows and [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/rubenvb/gcc-4.7-release/) for 32-bit. Note that there are cross compilers available which can run on Cygwin or Linux.
