Recently a serious x264 bug has been discovered. It makes your video look purple-ish. A comparison [here](http://tri4.net/subs/notes/44/why-do-you-have-so-many-version-ups) pretty much proves it.
This bug has been fixed in the latest version. Technically, all encodes encoded by x264 prior to the fix needs to be re-encoded. But I cannot find any information about the exact version number to which the fix has been applied.
