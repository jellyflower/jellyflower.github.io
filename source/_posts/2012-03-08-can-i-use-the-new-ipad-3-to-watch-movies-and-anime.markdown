I compared the video standard supported by the new iPad 3 with Blu-ray and pirates. So basically, the rumor that iPad 3 can play Blu-ray is wrong. It supports neither demuxing M2TS nor decoding PCM, Dolby or DTS. For video, you don't want a huge file occupying all the space on your iPad which plays only an hour. So, it looks like we need to do a bit encoding and muxing work. I'll probably do some research on how to massively and automatically prepare movies for iPad 3 and share my way, depending on whether I will spend money on this great toy.
